<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am currently a sophomore at Georgia State University, majoring in Computer Science. 
  Alongside my studies, I work full-time at an Amazon warehouse. Balancing school and work can be challenging, 
  but I’m committed to my goals and willing to put in the effort. I have a passion for numbers and a 
  keen eye for detail, always striving to understand how things function on a deeper level.</p>

<p>I’m originally from Cameroon, where I earned my high school diploma in 2016.
  After that, I pursued a bachelor’s degree in Commerce and Trade, focusing on Banking and Financial Institutions in 2019,
  in Yaoundé, Cameroon. This background gives me a unique blend of financial and technical knowledge, which 
  I believe will be invaluable as I continue to develop my skills in computer science.</p>

<p>My dream is to become a software developer, combining my expertise in banking with web development to
  create innovative solutions in the tech industry. Ultimately, I aim to build my own startup, where I can 
  help others bring their ideas to life by developing their websites. 
  I’m driven by a desire to empower others while also advancing my own career, and I’m excited about the journey ahead.</p>
